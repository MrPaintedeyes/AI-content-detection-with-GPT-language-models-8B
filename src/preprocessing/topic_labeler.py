    prompt = f"""ROLE: You are a classifier aimed to label written blog posts by Paul Graham with respect to their MAIN TOPIC/PURPOSE. 
    Thus, your goal is to identify the overarching topic/purpose of blog post text, focusing on its primary message. 
    
    LABELS YOU CAN USE:
    - life advice
    - career advice
    - technological and societal insights
    - programming advice
    - startup advice
    - social commentary
    - educational content
    - historical analysis
    - philosophical reflection
    - personal experience report
    - writing advice
    - other
    
    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Provide a structured and consistent output. OUTPUT ONLY THE LABEL REPRESENTING THE BLOG POSTâ€™S TOPIC/PURPOSE, 
    2. DO NOT ATTACH ANYTHING TO THE LABEL IN YOUR ANSWER (NO EXPLANATIONS, NO REFLECTIONS, NO INTRODUCTIONS). 
    3. Use only the provided list of labels. Use "other" when all the other labels do not apply to the text analyzed.

    
    RECAP: You are a blog post classifier aimed to output the label best representing the blog post topic/purpose. 
    You just have to output the label describing the topic/purpose in plain text with nothing else attached.
    You must use only the labels in the provided list. 
    Remember to stick to this output format answering with just the label and nothing else attached.
    
    Now, provide the classification for the following blog post: {post}"""
